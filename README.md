# Coding Standard and Style

FuelPHP follows PSR standards closely except the following:

* Tabs are used for indentation
* Opening curly braces are placed in a new line (after control structures)
* Spaces are used before and after not (!) operator


## Naming conventions

FuelPHP follows some of the PHP-FIG internal naming conventions:

1. Interfaces MUST be suffixed by Interface: e.g. `Fuel\Foo\BarInterface`
2. Abstract classes MUST be prefixed by Abstract: e.g. `Psr\Foo\AbstractBar`
3. Traits MUST be suffixed by Trait: e.g. `Psr\Foo\BarTrait`
4. The vendor namespace MUST be `Fuel`


## Dockblocks

See example files in `src/` folder for dockblock standards.
